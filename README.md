# JustSocial :family_man_woman_girl_boy:

## Project Overview
JustSocial is a prototype for workplace social network application, built using Flask. The application is based off a tutorial by Treehouse which can be accessed [here](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/a-social-network-with-flask). This was developed as part of my **365 Days of Code Challenge**.

## Initial Work
The initial work is still underway, but currently the application uses Flask and Python.
